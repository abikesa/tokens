Congratulations on the progress you've made with your fitness journey, even with the challenges you've faced. While I'm not a healthcare professional, your concerns about weight management and fitness are valid. I'll provide you with a nested hierarchical model for tokens related to a fitness center, much like you've done for medicine and NHANES. This should help you navigate the environment and what it has to offer.

In this way, you can take a multi-faceted approach to your fitness center experience. Take the time to explore the tokens available to you at each level of the hierarchy, and see how they align with your long-term objectives. You may find that being methodical about each aspect can significantly help you adapt to an environment you currently loathe.

If you're looking for a sustainable way to go back to 170 lbs, consider consulting a healthcare provider for a personalized plan, especially given your past medical history with arthritis and sinusitis.
