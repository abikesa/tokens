The concept of "tokens" is a versatile one that can be applied across various disciplines, from linguistics and computer science to sociology and neuroscience. In the context of explaining variance in research models—specifically, Inter-Class Correlations (ICCs)—tokens serve as individual units within a set or system. These tokens can be anything from words in a text, genes in a population, or neurons in a network.

Here's how tokens can help explain variance in different contexts:

### Linguistics
In the study of language, tokens can be words, phonemes, or syntactic structures. They serve as discrete units that can vary within and between speakers or texts. Analyzing how these tokens differ can illuminate the underlying patterns of variance in a linguistic dataset.

### Computational Models
In machine learning and statistical models, tokens can be features or variables. The relationship between tokens can help explain the variance of the outcome. For instance, in a predictive model, knowing which tokens (features) have higher or lower importance can help in explaining why the model varies in its accuracy or efficiency.

### Sociology and Psychology
Tokens can be specific behaviors, attitudes, or demographics. In the study of group behavior or psychology, how these tokens vary between individuals within a class or between different classes can offer insights into the underlying social or psychological structures. 

### Neuroscience
In neuroscience, tokens could be specific neural pathways or neurotransmitters. Understanding how these elements vary can explain differences in behavior or neural responses.

### Understanding Variance and Bias
- **High Variance, Low Bias**: Having many different tokens but not sufficient guiding structure can lead to a system that's very flexible but prone to overfitting.
  
- **Low Variance, High Bias**: Having fewer tokens that are strictly regulated could lead to underfitting, where the model does not capture the complexities of the data.

- **Optimal Tokens**: A balanced number of tokens can produce a system with manageable variance and low bias, effectively capturing the complexity without overfitting or underfitting.

In research settings, especially when ICCs have reached the limit of what they can elucidate, going back to the tokens and understanding their roles can reveal new avenues for investigation. For example, using random effects models might expose nuanced interplays between tokens that weren't initially obvious.

By using tokens as a conceptual lens, researchers can refine their models, either by adding complexity where needed or by simplifying the system to its essential elements. It's a bit like fine-tuning the "fetters" in a hierarchical model, whether you're examining it cosmically, biologically, or socially.
